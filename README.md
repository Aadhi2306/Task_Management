# Build a Complete Responsive Task Management System | HTML & CSS & Javascript | 

We will build a two-pages task management system. We will work intensively with HTML & CSS. And we are going to use Javascript as well to add some user interactions. What we will accomplish together:

⚙️ Build login/signup page

⚙️ Build dashboard page

⚙️ Display tasks in two different ways: list & board views

⚙️ Build popups: add task & view task popups

⚙️ Build a design system using CSS custom properties

⚙️ Construct fully responsive pages

⚙️ Show/hide elements

⚙️ Show feedback notifications

## Run

If you are using Visual Studio Code, use live server extension to run the project in the brower. Or similar extension in your editor of choise. Or even simpler, open the html page directly in your favorite browser😉
